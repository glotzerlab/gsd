GSD documentation
+++++++++++++++++

The **GSD** file format is the native file format for `HOOMD-blue <https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/>`_.
**GSD** files store trajectories of the HOOMD-blue system state in a binary file with efficient random access to
frames. **GSD** allows all particle and topology properties to vary from one frame to the next. Use the **GSD** Python
API to specify the initial condition for a HOOMD-blue simulation or analyze trajectory output with a script. Read a
**GSD** trajectory with a visualization tool to explore the behavior of the simulation.
