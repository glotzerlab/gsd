HOOMD Schema
============

HOOMD-blue supports a wide variety of per particle attributes and properties.
Particles, bonds, and types can be dynamically added and removed during
simulation runs. The ``hoomd`` schema can handle all of these situations in a
reasonably space efficient and high performance manner. It is also backwards
compatible with previous versions of itself, as we only add new additional data
chunks in new versions and do not change the interpretation of the existing data
chunks. Any newer reader will initialize new data chunks with default values
when they are not present in an older version file.

:Schema name: ``hoomd``
:Schema version: 1.4

Use-cases
---------

The GSD schema ``hoomd`` provides:

#. Every frame of GSD output is viable to restart a simulation
#. Support varying numbers of particles, bonds, etc...
#. Support varying attributes (type, mass, etc...)
#. Support orientation, angular momentum, and other fields.
#. Binary format on disk
#. High performance file read and write
#. Support logging computed quantities

Data chunks
-----------

Each frame the ``hoomd`` schema may contain one or more data chunks. The layout
and names of the chunksmatch that of the binary snapshot API in HOOMD-blue
itself. Data chunks are organized in categories. These categories have no
meaning in the ``hoomd`` schema specification, and are simply an organizational
tool. Some file writers may implement options that act on categories (i.e. write
**attributes** out to every frame, or just frame 0).

Values are well defined for all fields at all frames. When a data chunk is
present in frame *i*, it defines the values for the frame. When it is not
present, the data chunk of the same name at frame 0 defines the values for frame
*i* (when *N* is equal between the frames). If the data chunk is not present in
frame 0, or *N* differs between frames, values are default. Default values allow
files sizes to remain small. For example, a simulation with point particles
where orientation is always (1,0,0,0) would not write any orientation chunk to
the file.

*N* may be zero. When *N* is zero, an index entry may be written for a data
chunk with no actual data written to the file for that chunk.

Configuration
-------------

.. chunk:: configuration/step

    :Type: uint64
    :Size: 1x1
    :Default: 0
    :Units: number

    Simulation time step.

.. chunk:: configuration/dimensions

    :Type: uint8
    :Size: 1x1
    :Default: 3
    :Units: number

    Number of dimensions in the simulation. Must be 2 or 3.

    .. note::
        When using `gsd.hoomd.Snapshot`, the object will try to intelligently default to a
        dimension. If setting the box to a box where :math:`L_z = 0`, ``dimensions`` will default to
        2 otherwise 3. Explicit setting of this value by users always takes precedence.

.. chunk:: configuration/box

    :Type: float
    :Size: 6x1
    :Default: [1,1,1,0,0,0]
    :Units: *varies*

    Simulation box. Each array element defines a different box property. See the
    hoomd documentation for a full description on how these box parameters map
    to a triclinic geometry.

    * ``box[0:3]``: :math:`(l_x, l_y, l_z)` the box length in each direction, in length units
    * ``box[3:]``: :math:`(xy, xz, yz)` the tilt factors, unitless values


Particle data
-------------

Within a single frame, the number of particles *N* and *NT* are fixed for all
chunks. *N* and *NT* may vary from one frame to the next. All values are stored
in hoomd native units.

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

.. chunk:: particles/N

    :Type: uint32
    :Size: 1x1
    :Default: 0
    :Units: number

    Define *N*, the number of particles, for all data chunks ``particles/*``.

.. chunk:: particles/types

    :Type: int8
    :Size: NTxM
    :Default: ['A']
    :Units: UTF-8

    Implicitly define *NT*, the number of particle types, for all data chunks
    ``particles/*``. *M* must be large enough to accommodate each type name as a
    null terminated UTF-8 character string. Row *i* of the 2D matrix is the type
    name for particle type *i*.

.. chunk:: particles/typeid

    :Type: uint32
    :Size: Nx1
    :Default: 0
    :Units: number

    Store the type id of each particle. All id's must be less than *NT*. A
    particle with type *id* has a type name matching the corresponding row in
    :chunk:`particles/types`.

.. chunk:: particles/type_shapes

    :Type: int8
    :Size: NTxM
    :Default: *empty*
    :Units: UTF-8

    Store a per-type shape definition for visualization. A dictionary is stored
    for each of the *NT* types, corresponding to a shape for visualization of
    that type. *M* must be large enough to accommodate the shape definition as
    a null-terminated UTF-8 JSON-encoded string. See: :ref:`shapes` for
    examples.

.. chunk:: particles/mass

.. chunk:: particles/body

    :Type: int32
    :Size: Nx1
    :Default: -1
    :Units: number

    Store the composite body associated with each particle. The value -1
    indicates no body. The body field may be left out of input files, as hoomd
    will create the needed constituent particles.

.. chunk:: particles/moment_inertia

    :Type: float (32-bit)
    :Size: Nx3
    :Default: 0,0,0
    :Units: mass * length^2

    Store the moment_inertia of each particle :math:`(I_{xx}, I_{yy}, I_{zz})`.
    This inertia tensor is diagonal in the body frame of the particle. The
    default value is for point particles.

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

.. chunk:: particles/position

    :Type: float (32-bit)
    :Size: Nx3
    :Default: 0,0,0
    :Units: length

    Store the position of each particle (*x*, *y*, *z*).

    All particles in the simulation are referenced by a tag. The position data
    chunk (and all other per particle data chunks) list particles in tag order.
    The first particle listed has tag 0, the second has tag 1, ..., and the last
    has tag N-1 where N is the number of particles in the simulation.

    All particles must be inside the box:

    * :math:`x > -l_x/2 + (xz-xy \cdot yz) \cdot z + xy  \cdot  y` and :math:`x < l_x/2 + (xz-xy \cdot yz) \cdot z + xy  \cdot  y`
    * :math:`y > -l_y/2 + yz  \cdot  z` and :math:`y < l_y/2 + yz \cdot z`
    * :math:`z > -l_z/2` and :math:`z < l_z/2`


.. chunk:: particles/orientation

    :Type: float (32-bit)
    :Size: Nx4
    :Default: 1,0,0,0
    :Units: unit quaternion

    Store the orientation of each particle. In scalar + vector notation, this is
    :math:`(r, a_x, a_y, a_z)`,
    where the quaternion is :math:`q = r + a_xi + a_yj + a_zk`. A unit
    quaternion has the property: :math:`\sqrt{r^2 + a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2} = 1`.

    :Type: int32
    :Size: Nx3
    :Default: 0,0,0
    :Units: number

    Store the number of times each particle has wrapped around the box
    :math:`(i_x, i_y, i_z)`. In constant volume simulations, the unwrapped
    position in the particle's full trajectory is

    * :math:`x_u = x + i_x \cdot l_x + xy \cdot i_y \cdot l_y + xz \cdot i_z \cdot l_z`
    * :math:`y_u = y + i_y \cdot l_y + yz \cdot i_z \cdot l_z`

Logged data
------------

Users may store logged data in ``log/*`` data chunks. Logged data encompasses
values computed at simulation time that are too expensive or cumbersome to
re-compute in post processing. This specification does not define specific chunk
names or define logged data. Users may select any valid name for logged data
chunks as appropriate for their workflow.

For any named logged data chunks present in any frame frame the file: If a chunk
is not present in a given frame i != 0, the implementation should provide the
quantity as read from frame 0 for that frame. GSD files that include a logged
data chunk only in some frames i != 0 and not in frame 0 are invalid.

By convention, per-particle and per-bond logged data should have a chunk name
starting with ``log/particles/`` and ``log/bonds``, respectively. Scalar,
vector, and string values may be stored under a different prefix starting with
``log/``. This specification may recognize additional conventions in later
versions without invalidating existing files.

    quantities. *N* is the number of particles in this frame. *M*, the data
    type, the units, and the chunk name (after the prefix ``log/particles/``)

    This chunk is a place holder for any number of user defined quantities. *N*,
    *M*, the data type, the units, and the chunk name (after the prefix
    ``log/``) are user-defined.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

State data
------------

HOOMD stores auxiliary state information in ``state/*`` data chunks. Auxiliary
state encompasses internal state to any integrator, updater, or other class that
is not part of the particle system state but is also not a fixed parameter. For
example, the internal degrees of freedom in integrator. Auxiliary state is
useful when restarting simulations.

HOOMD only stores state in GSD files when requested explicitly by the user. Only
a few of the documented state data chunks will be present in any GSD file and
not all state chunks are valid. Thus, state data chunks do not have default
values. If a chunk is not present in the file, that state does not have a
well-defined value.

.. note::

    HOOMD-blue versions 3.0 and newer write state data in an application defined
    format in ``log/*``, **not** in ``state/*``. See the HOOMD-blue
    documentation for details on the data chunks it reads and writes.
